          You can be sure that you are in good hands with "Rescued Australian Shepherd". They made me confident about our purchase of a puppy online and ensured that we will get a beautiful healthy Aussie puppy. They were available to answer questions from day 1 and even days after our puppy was delivered.

        <p>It was nevertheless a good experience and relation we had with our aussie pups though we had to be very attentive as they were too fragile on their arrival but are strong loving puppies now. Please don't hesitate to contact us on any need puppy. Thanks.

          Greetings! I wanna thank the sales service manager for the patient and comprehensiveness he had with me as he was so on top of my puppy to get her home to us as quickly and safely as possible despite my constant pressure. Thank you for always communicating with me and now making me a Mommy!!! We re-named her Lyla, and she is the best thing that has ever happened to us.

          Our experience with your team was quite great though we had some delays! We are thrilled with our little 'Anderson'. He is full of characteristics we were looking for and is settling into our family beautifully.

          I can't believe how she was barking when I came to pick her up as someone could say we knew each other as joyful as both of us looked. Once again thank you for proving me wrong on your centre's credibility.

          Got my little Portia from rescued Australian shepherd. From there, she paved the way for me to breed. Therefore, making my dreams have puppies. She is a real example of an Aussie.

          This is our first dog so we were really nervous about finding the right one that would work for our family and lifestyle. "Rescued Australian Shepherd" made the process so easy and full proof. Our little angel was actually delivered directly to our doorstep, which was amazing since we are in PA. The breeder must have done some training with him because he is absolutely the best puppy we could have ever gotten.
