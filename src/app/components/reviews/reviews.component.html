        <p>It was nevertheless a good experience and relation we had with our aussie pups though we had to be very attentive as they were too fragile on their arrival but are strong loving puppies now. Please don't hesitate to contact us on any need puppy. Thanks.

          Thanks for the update in your emails, it lead to my son having a new playmate, and they just can't be separated.

          Greetings! I wanna thank the sales service manager for the patient and comprehensiveness he had with me as he was so on top of my puppy to get her home to us as quickly and safely as possible despite my constant pressure. Thank you for always communicating with me and now making me a Mommy!!! We re-named her Lyla, and she is the best thing that has ever happened to us.

          Our experience with your team was quite great though we had some delays! We are thrilled with our little 'Anderson'. He is full of characteristics we were looking for and is settling into our family beautifully.

          I can't believe how she was barking when I came to pick her up as someone could say we knew each other as joyful as both of us looked. Once again thank you for proving me wrong on your centre's credibility.
