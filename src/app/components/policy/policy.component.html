          <h4>Puppy Reservation Policies.</h4>
          <p>Puppy Reservations and Policies.
            We have a  litter at least once a year to every other year. You will be sent a puppy reservation form. Once we receive your deposit and form we log the date your deposit is received and place you on our list for a puppy.
            Note that the reservation fee varies depending on the litter type.<br>
            <strong>Please keep in mind that your deposit is non-refundable unless we can't provide you with a puppy.</strong>
            We take reservations before the birth of the puppies and also accept advanced reservations for future puppies.  If we do not get your desired gender in the litter, we will offer you one opposite-gender pup or move your deposit onto another upcoming litter.
            We do ultrasounds on our females to confirm pregnancy since we donâ€™t want our clients waiting for a puppy longer than needed.
